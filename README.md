# BurgerApp
============

## Description

This is Eat-Da-burger application, the user should be able to add the new burger name by clicking on the "submit" button . The new list will be added under the "Not Devoured" list which is on the left side of the page ,once the user click on the "devour it" button , the value should be updated on the right side of the page  This is an command line interface app which is created using node.js and mysql.

## Process

I started out by installing all the necessary npm libraries and creating necessary folders based on the MVC structure.Started with creating the server first and then the routes and the necessary files for data modeling and then the queries to insert, update and delete value from the web page.
